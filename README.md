# Zoo Monitoring Dashboard

### üìÅ Dependencies

- __React__ _v16.13.1_
- __Materal-UI__ _v4.10.2_
- __Highcharts.js__ _v8.1.2_
- __Highcharts React Official__ _v3.0.0_

### üîç Problem Statement

I own a small not-for-profit zoo that is privately managed and supported by society. Currently, I have problem on managing the zoo, as the data is in a mess and all over the place. To resolve the problem as well as provide transparency among the volunteers, I plan to create a simple monitoring dashboard for the zoo. The dashboard includes report for data such as animals‚Äô health, food procurement, food consumption, and ticket selling.

### ‚≠ê Result
